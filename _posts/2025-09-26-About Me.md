I am Edwin Lee, a technical developer deeply passionate about 3D artistry. Proficient in Unity 3D, Unreal Engine 4, and Three.js, I also master full-stack technologies like Flutter, Python, and .NET—blending code logic with visual creativity. As a photography enthusiast, I draw inspiration from natural light: morning mist and twilight hues directly inform my virtual reflections and environmental atmospheres in 3D scenes. I believe technology is the brush for art, and efficiency is the breath of creation. Whether crafting mobile-friendly interactions or high-fidelity vehicle renders, I relentlessly pursue the balance between performance and visual beauty. In my free time, I capture real-world textures through hiking photography, then infuse that subtlety into digital artistry. Let’s illuminate the boundary between virtual and reality—together!
